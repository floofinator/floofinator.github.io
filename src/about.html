    <h3>Interests and Goals</h3>

            <p>
                My interests in general revolve around the use of technical skills for creative works. I am
                constantly learning how technical mediums can be used to teach and entertain.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish to work on genuine projects with a passionate team who can make things into a reality. I
                enjoy
                creating immersive worlds and experiences to be viewed and interacted with. My hope is to prove
                that video games can be an impactful medium for art.
