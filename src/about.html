                I am Luke Thomson, but I also go by 'Floofinator' on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                This alias intends to evoke my passions. 'Floof' evokes a sense of playful softness and thoughtfulness,
                while the suffix '-inator' conveys the power to create through design and technical strength like
                the evil geniuses before me.
            </p>
            <p>
                My admiration for technical systems leads me to learn endlessly on how to manifest them into being. 
                Seeing a system work in a well designed manner is very satisfying to me and the prospect that I can achieve the same drives me. 
                I grew up very technically minded, but overtime I grew to dream of expressing ideas through creating art and stories.
                I now know that the best way to achieve this is for me to combine these thoughts into a well designed mess.
            </p>
            <p>
                My early life involved a decent quantity of moves around the globe.
                I am a Californian born, Australian lived, currently Florida residing individual. 
                Because of this I have been to many different schools and made connections with
                many different people and areas of the world.
            </p>
            <p> 
                One of my goals in life is to visit and appreciate the many different parts of the world and understand their cultures.
                Fortunately for me, I have travelled to the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Italy, France, Monaco, The Vatican, and Spain.
                The internet has helped in my open worldview greatly and I will continue to connect with as wide a range of people as I can.

    <h3>Interests and Goals</h3>

            <p>
                My interests in general revolve around the use of technical skills for creative works. I am
                constantly
                learning how technical mediums can be used to teach and entertain.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish to work on genuine projects with a passionate team who can make things into a reality. I
                enjoy
                creating immersive worlds and experiences to be viewed and interacted with. My hope is to prove
                that video
                games can be an impactful medium for art.
