    <h2>
        3D Animation for Trailer
    </h2>
    <p>
        I helped animate 3D character to be composited into 2D animation.
        Animated based on a 2d animatic reference.
        Used a hold out plane to render the character models with a transparent cutoff at the surface of the liquid.
