    <h2>
        Tinker Burrow is a vehicle building game centered around bunnies digging holes.

    <h3>Literal Dream Game</h3>
    <p>
        Inspiration can come from anything and everything. 
        In the case of this game's strange mechanics, I found myself trying to recall the strange visuals in a dream.
    </p>
    <h3>Sketching Ideas</h3>
    <p>Initial quick sketches done on sticky notes.</p>

    <h3>Walking With Gum on Your Shoe</h3>
    <p>
        It can be very tempting to polish a mechanic before moving on to the rest of the game. 
        I tried to use this project as a lesson to focus on the wider vision of the game instead of small details.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine walking down the street in a big city on your way to some location. 
        While walking you feel the bottom of your shoe stick to the pavement. 
        You know immediately you stepped in some gum which now makes your walk more unpleasant.
        If you stopped right now you could maybe scrape it off with tiresome difficulty, 
        but standing with your foot awkwardly yanked upward in the loud street is a less than stellar situation.
        It is better to keep walking with the slight discomfort at the back of your mind, 
        waiting till you've reached the end of your walk to finally scape off the gunk.
