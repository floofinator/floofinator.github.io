                                I am Luke Thomson, but I also go by Floofinator on the internet!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From a young age I have loved technical concepts and complex mechanisms. Seeing a system
                                work in a
                                well designed manner is very satisfying to me. I started out being very technically
                                minded, but overtime I
                                have grown to love expressing ideas by creating art and stories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beyond living in places, I have also travelled to the United Kingdom, Ireland, and
                                Canada. One of my goals in life is to visit and appreciate the many different parts of
                                the world and
                                understand their cultures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am a Californian born, Australian
                                lived, currently Florida residing individual. My early life involved much moving around
                                and living in different
                                places. Because of this I have been to many different schools and made connections with
                                many different
                                people and areas of the world.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        My interests in general revolve around the use of technical skills for creative works. I am
                        constantly
                        learning how technical mediums can be used to teach and entertain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wish to work on genuine projects with a passionate team who can make things into a reality. I
                        enjoy
                        creating immersive worlds and experiences to be viewed and interacted with. My hope is to prove
                        that video
                        games can be an impactful medium for art.
